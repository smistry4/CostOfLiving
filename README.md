## Description
This project aims to find relationships between factors contributing to the cost of living. We aim to address specific research question, such as the influence of geographical areas on the factors and cost of living. We also analyze the impact of family size on cost of living. Finally, we discover counties which are most and least affordable in U.S. and Tennessee based on 2 adult 2 children family size.
